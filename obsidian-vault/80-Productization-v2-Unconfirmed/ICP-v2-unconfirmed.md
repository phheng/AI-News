# [未确认版本] ICP v2（North America）

## 1) Segmentation Model
### Primary ICP
**Brand-led SMB (Private Label)**
- Team: 2-15
- Need: margin protection + predictable growth
- Willingness to pay: high if ROI is measurable

### Secondary ICP
**Wholesale / Authorized Reseller**
- Team: 3-20
- Need: turnover efficiency + fee/price sensitivity management
- Willingness to pay: medium-high for operational certainty

### Selective ICP
**Arbitrage-heavy operators**
- Need: rapid filtering + risk control
- Risk: high churn and lower durable value

### Defer
- Dropshipping (compliance fragility)
- Handmade (small scale, lower immediate expansion value)

## 2) NA-Specific Behavioral Signals
- Strong preference for auditability and explainability
- Higher sensitivity to compliance/account risk
- Value concentration on ad spend efficiency and inventory cashflow

## 3) Jobs-to-be-Done by Segment
- **Primary**: reduce wasted ad spend, prevent stock-outs, speed competitor response
- **Secondary**: stabilize margin under fee shifts, improve replenishment precision
- **Selective**: reduce operational noise and policy exposure

## 4) Pains (Prioritized)
1. Tool fragmentation -> slow decisions
2. Rising ad costs with weak attribution confidence
3. Inventory imbalance (OOS vs overstock)
4. Competitive volatility faster than manual response
5. Automation fear without rollback/audit guarantees

## 5) Value Promise by Segment
- Primary: “measurable weekly business lift + controllable automation”
- Secondary: “margin and cashflow protection through operational intelligence”
- Selective: “faster filtering and lower compliance mistakes”

## 6) Commercial Prioritization
- Wave 1: Primary + Secondary
- Wave 2: Selective as low-touch entry
- Wave 3: Defer segments after governance maturity

## 7) ICP Qualification Checklist (Go/No-go)
- Has stable SKU set and ad activity
- Can provide basic operational data
- Has explicit KPI ownership
- Accepts approval-based execution model
